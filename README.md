## **Introduction**

Researchers face challenges in staying up-to-date with the overwhelming volume of academic papers published daily. This platform addresses these challenges by:
- Simplifying the discovery of relevant research papers.
- Providing AI-powered summaries to save time.
- Offering advanced search and filtering options tailored to academic needs.

Whether you're a student, professor, or industry researcher, our platform aims to enhance your research workflow.

---

## **Features**

- **Semantic Search:** Retrieve papers based on meaning rather than keywords.
- **Summarization:** Get concise, AI-generated summaries of research papers.
- **Citation Management:** Directly access proper citations for all results.
- **Custom Alerts:** Stay informed with email notifications for topics of interest.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for streamlined interaction.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Filter results by author, year, journal, and more.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**
- React.js for the user interface.
- Material-UI for styling.

### **Backend**
- FastAPI for API development.
- Python for core logic and integrations.

### **Database**
- PostgreSQL for metadata storage.
- Pinecone/FAISS for vector-based semantic search.

### **AI Models**
- Pretrained models like BART/PEGASUS for summarization.
- Fine-tuned embeddings for semantic search.

### **Deployment**
- Docker for containerization.
- Kubernetes for orchestration.
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

## **System Architecture**

The system is divided into the following components:
1. **Data Ingestion:** Integrates APIs (e.g., arXiv, PubMed) and preprocesses the data.
2. **Search Engine:** Vector-based semantic search with fast response times.
3. **Summarization Engine:** Summarizes papers using fine-tuned transformer models.
4. **Frontend:** A clean and interactive UI for user interaction.
5. **Deployment & Monitoring:** Scalable infrastructure with real-time monitoring.

For a detailed architecture diagram, refer to the `docs/architecture.png` file.

## **How It Works**

1. **Input a Query:** Enter a natural language query into the search bar.
2. **Semantic Search:** The system retrieves relevant papers using vector-based search.
3. **Summarization:** Summaries of papers are generated using advanced AI models.
4. **Interaction:** Filter, sort, and export results as needed.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Expand data sources to include more repositories.
- Support multiple languages for global accessibility.
- Implement co-citation and citation network visualizations.
- Integrate collaborative tools for researchers to share insights.
